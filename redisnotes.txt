First install redis in terminal (make sure brew is active in the terminal instance)

    brew install redis

Add brew to your PATH by adding the following line to .zshrc (on Mac):

    eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"

Still make sure brew is active or in your path to run redis.
To start the redis server, run:
    redis-server
This will only be temporary in the foreground and you can stop the server through Ctrl-C

If you want to run the redis server in the background (as a service), run:

    brew services start redis


This launches Redis and restarts it at login.
You can check the status of a launchd managed Redis by running the following:

    brew services info redis


If the service is running, you'll see output like the following:

    redis (homebrew.mxcl.redis)
    Running: ✔
    Loaded: ✔
    User: gailcliff
    PID: 67975


To stop the service, run:

    brew services stop redis


To test redis as a client, run the:
      redis-cli
command. You will be able to add and pop key-value pairs.
A client can be something else like python code!
